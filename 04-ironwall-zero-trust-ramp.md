## 🌱 Opening Narrative

👨‍💼 **Mr. Eks2** sat beneath a fig tree in the cloud courtyard, holding a handful of different security frameworks.

“So many paths,” he murmured. “Which one leads to a meaningful start?”

🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera** approached with her usual serenity, holding a worn but glowing scroll labeled **Zero Trust RaMP**.

“This,” she smiled, “is for when the first step must be swift — but still rooted in wisdom.”

High above, as always unseen, 👁️ **I.K.** offered a thought that flowed like water:

> “In a world that moves fast, begin with what is both **urgent and anchored**.”

A regional cloud team wanted Zero Trust. But they were stuck in whitepapers and theory.

Then came RaMP — with its checklists, clear tasks, and focused impact. Within weeks, they had tangible progress.  
Access policies were reviewed. MFA was enforced. Logs found meaning.

They didn’t just *read* Zero Trust.  
They *lived* it — one quick win at a time.
